## Features

- **Cute Design**: Custom illustrations of animals on the cards, all designed by me.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose from different levels of difficulty, which affect the number of cards on the board.
- **Timer**: A timer that tracks how long it takes you to finish the game.
- **Move Counter**: Count the number of moves you make while playing.

## How to Play

- Flip the cards by clicking on them to reveal animal images.
- Try to match pairs of the same animal.
- The game ends when all pairs are matched.
- The goal is to complete the game with the fewest moves and in the shortest time.
